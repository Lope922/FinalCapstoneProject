This is my first ASP.NET app that i am building using MVC and Entity Framework.
    This application is intended to learn the basics of creating and developing a
    Web App in C# using the tools mentioned above. .</p>

 The function of this app is to allow a record resale shop to allow the tracking of cosignors that bring in albums to a store.
    The store then attempts to sell the ablums within 30 days. If sold the cosinor that has brought in the album is entitled to a portion of the sales. 
    Else if the Albums have not sold within 30 days they are either returned to the owner or donated. More features may be added later. 
    Those are just the basics of this app.
